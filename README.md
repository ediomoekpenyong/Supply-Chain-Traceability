# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Traceability for Conflict-Free Minerals

## Overview
The **Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Traceability for Conflict-Free Minerals** is a decentralized platform designed to track the origin and journey of minerals, ensuring ethical sourcing. It leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFTs to provide transparency and accountability in the supply chain.

## Features
- **Transparent Supply Chain**: Ensures that minerals are sourced ethically and meet regulatory compliance.
- **Smart Contracts**:
    - **Supply Chain Tracking**: Records each step from mine to manufacturer immutably.
    - **Verification & Compliance**: Ensures compliance with ethical sourcing regulations.
    - **Automated Transactions**: Facilitates payments and transfers securely.
- **NFT Integration**:
    - **Batch Representation**: NFTs represent mineral batches with complete provenance.
    - **Ownership & Transfer**: Enables secure and trackable ownership changes.
- **IoT & Testing Lab Integration**:
    - Real-time data collection from mining sites and transit.
    - Automated verification and certification from testing labs.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Hyperledger, or Stacks
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity, Clarity
- **Storage**: IPFS/Arweave for decentralized storage
- **NFTs**: ERC-721/ERC-1155 for mineral batch tracking
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for off-chain metadata

## How It Works
1. **Mineral Extraction**:
    - IoT sensors capture mining details.
    - Data is recorded immutably on the blockchain.
2. **Processing & Testing**:
    - Testing labs verify mineral composition and ethics compliance.
    - Verified minerals are assigned NFTs with provenance data.
3. **Supply Chain Tracking**:
    - Each transit point is logged via smart contracts.
    - Updates are stored immutably for transparency.
4. **Manufacturing & Distribution**:
    - Manufacturers access verified mineral data.
    - Consumers can trace the mineral’s origin.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
